venue-description: >
    *Silt* is a literary publication run by students in MIT's Department of Urban Studies and Planning. This issue focused
    on themes of home, homeland, homesickness, visions of home, creating a home, and much more.
long-description: >
    I wrote “Welcome Home” for the inaugural edition of *Silt*. Inspired by my own experiences working in diplomacy and international development, “Welcome Home” explores questions of identity, positionality, and purpose that so many foreign service professionals experience as they navigate transnational careers.
